    /*
    Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents,
    and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm}
    valued coins, how many ways can we make the change?

    The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
    For example, for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3},
    there are four solutions:
     {1,1,1,1},
     {1,1,2},
     {2,2},
     {1,3}.
     So output should be 4.

     For N = 10 and S = {2, 5, 3, 6},
     there are five solutions:
      {2,2,2,2,2},
       {2,2,3,3},
        {2,2,6},
        {2,3,5}
         and
          {5,5}.
           So the output should be 5.
