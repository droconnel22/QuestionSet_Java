Events are one of the more overlooked functionalities in the framework
 but also one of the more useful. And – like many other things in Spring –
event publishing is one of the capabilities provided by ApplicationContext.

There are a few simple guidelines to follow:

*the event should extend ApplicationEvent
*the publisher should inject an ApplicationEventPublisher object
*the listener should implement the ApplicationListener interface

Spring allows to create and publish custom events which – by default –
are synchronous. This has a few advantages – such as, for example,
 the listener being able to participate in the publisher’s
 transaction context.
